smarter_foundation
==================

Customized theme for my own site.

Largely based on **smart_foundation**: https://github.com/smartmediaas/smart_foundation

## Uses Grunt, Bower, Foundation 5, Sass/Compass

Currently in use or planned: linting, minify/concat, sourcemaps, etc.

More to goodness to come.

Performance is high priority so web fonts are hard-coded as are language attributes and such,
which eliminates database calls.

Assets will likely use version revving and not have query strings.

Unneeded elements will be removed, etc.


### Most of this is mentioned in *smart_foundation* but a tip of the hat to:

Color scheme inspired by W3C site http://www.w3.org
